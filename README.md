# CannyEdgeDetector

The Problem of Canny Edge Detector works on the logic smoothening of the Image using Gaussian Filter, later removing the weak edges and tracing the Dark Edges using Hysteresis. The project thus was to parallelize the process by dividing and working computations parallelly on various cores to help improve the performance.
